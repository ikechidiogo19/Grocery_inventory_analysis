This project focuses on inventory and sales data analysis to help optimize supply chain decisions, reduce waste, and improve overall product performance. The dataset contains information about products, their suppliers, stock levels, reorder status, sales volume, inventory turnover, and expiry date.
By analyzing this dataset, we aim to identify high-performing products, underperforming inventory, supplier efficiency, and financial losses due to product expiration.
